This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing Play Store data, with a keen focus on app engagement, user sentiment, and revenue generation. The project unfolds in two fundamental phases: Data Preprocessing and Visualization utilizing Tableau.

## Data Preprocessing
Python was employed to conduct various data preprocessing tasks, such as deduplicating entries, addressing missing values, trimming redundant columns, standardizing data types, and mitigating outliers. These meticulous steps were crucial in upholding the dataset's integrity, priming it for in-depth analysis.

## Visualization with Tableau
The purified dataset was brought to life via dynamic, interactive dashboards crafted in Tableau. These dashboards offer valuable insights into app engagement, sentiment analysis, and revenue trends. Leveraging a spectrum of Tableau features, including calculated fields, filters, parameters, and action filters, user interaction and exploration were significantly enhanced.

### Dashboards Created
1. **App Engagement Dashboard:** Provides insights into user interactions and app popularity.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:** Explores user sentiments and opinions about the apps.
3. **Revenue Dashboard:** Highlights the financial performance and revenue trends of apps.

## Tableau Story
The project reaches its apex with a unified Tableau story that harmonizes all three dashboards. This integration facilitates effortless navigation between distinct perspectives of the Play Store data, encompassing engagement, sentiment, and revenue metrics.

## Conclusion
In its final Tableau story format, the project delivers a holistic perspective on the Play Store data, fostering profound insights and empowering informed decision-making.
